  description: "GO-CAM (Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models) is a framework that extends standard GO annotations by connecting molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components into causally linked pathways. GO-CAMs provide explicit causal connections between gene products and their activities within specific biological contexts, enabling more detailed representation of biological mechanisms than traditional GO annotations."

  utility: "GO-CAMs provide structured causal relationships between gene products that are essential for pathway analysis, mechanistic understanding, and systems biology approaches in Translator. Unlike traditional GO annotations, GO-CAMs explicitly model how gene products causally regulate each other, making them valuable for reasoning about biological mechanisms and predicting downstream effects of perturbations."
  scope: "This initial ingest focuses on gene-to-gene causal regulatory relationships extracted from GO-CAM models. The scope includes direct regulatory relationships (positive and negative regulation) between gene products, with associated molecular function, biological process, and cellular component annotations for context."

  future_considerations:
    - category: edge_content
      consideration: "Currently, we are excluding GOTerms from the edges. This is just a first pass at the GO-CAMs to get the Gene to Gene edges in place. Future iterations will include the GOTerms, and potentially other edge types."
    - category: node_property_content
      consideration: "Includes only the gene identifier and category of 'Gene'. (Note, there are likely nodes that represent Genes or Gene Products, but we are not distinguishing between these at this time because we will NodeNormalize the category and id.)"
    - category: edge_property_content
      consideration: "TODO: plenty of work to do here to make edges like this, Biolink compliant past the source, target, and causal_predicate which are mapped in this ingest to 'biolink:subject', 'biolink:object', and the appropriate 'biolink:predicate' respectively. The edge properties are not currently being mapped to Biolink Model edge properties, but this will be done in future iterations."

  # Note: additional_notes field has been removed from this section according to new schema
  # Previous use cases: Use cases for Translator usage of this data: chemical to disease but put g2g in there then more pathways are available. gene to chemical target then to a secondary disease drugmechdb <-- how do all drugs interact with a target that treats a disease or the disease itself drug treats aspirin - but not useful if you put genes into it

All edges are manual agent knowledge assertions as GO-CAMs are manually curated models of biological mechanisms. Edge properties preserve the functional context (molecular function, biological process, cellular component) for both source and target genes."
