  description: "SIGNOR 3.0, https://signor.uniroma2.it, is a public repository that captures causal information and represents it according to an 'activity-flow' model. SIGNOR provides freely-accessible static maps of causal interactions that can be tailored, pruned and refined to build dynamic and predictive models. Each signaling relationship is annotated with an effect (up/down-regulation) and with the mechanism (e.g. binding, phosphorylation, transcriptional activation, etc.) causing the regulation of the target entity. Since its latest release, SIGNOR has undergone a significant upgrade including: (i) a new website that offers an improved user experience and novel advanced search and graph tools; (ii) a significant content growth adding up to a total of approx. 33,000 manually-annotated causal relationships between more than 8900 biological entities; (iii) an increase in the number of manually annotated pathways, currently including pathways deregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection or involved in neurodevelopment synaptic transmission and metabolism, among others; (iv) additional features such as new model to represent metabolic reactions and a new confidence score assigned to each interaction."

  utility: "Signor is a rich source of manually curated genetic associations to other biological entities which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including treatment predictions, gene-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries. It is one of the sources that focus on drug and genes."
  scope: "This initial ingest of Signor covers curated Gene to Gene associations that report therapeutic and marker/mechanism relationships, and inferred statistical associations generated by Signor."
