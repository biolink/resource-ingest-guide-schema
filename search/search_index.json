FilteredContent A structure for describing the types of records from each relevant file/endpoint/table not included in the ingest, and the rationale for any filtering rules or exclusion criteria. Only list a file if some but not all records it contains are included in the ingest - to document what subset was excluded, and why. FutureContentConsiderations A structure for collecting notes about content additions or changes to consider in future iterations of this ingest. Create separate objects for each distinct consideration, and indicate if it relates to  content that will be captured as Edges, Node Properties, or Edge Properties in the target knowledge graph. FutureModelingConsiderations A structure for collecting discrete considerations about modeling changes to consider in future iterations of this ingest. Create and categorize separate objects for each distinct consideration. IncludedContent A structure for describing the types of records from relevant files/endpoints/tables are included in this ingest, and optionally a list of fields from these records that are part of the ingest or used to inform it. IngestInformation A container for capturing information about the rationale and scope of an ingest, including what source content was included and excluded from the ingest, and what additional content might be considered in future iterations. NodeType A structured object describing each type of node created in the target knowledge graph by this ingest. ProvenanceInformation A container holding information about the provenance of the ingest, including who contributed and how, and links to external provenance artifacts. Qualifier A qualifier property + value tuple that specifies a type of qualifier and value that may be applied to a Statement. Qualfied predicates are considered qualifiers and captured here as well. Values can be specified to come from a proper range (e.g. Biolink class, data type, or enum), be a constant (e.g. \"biolink\"causes\"), use a specific id prefix, and/or using a free-text description. ReferenceIngestGuide A container that holds attributes for the discrete sections of information comprising a Resource Ingest Guide. RelevantFiles A structure for describing each source file (or API endpoint, database, or table) that contains content in scope for the ingest. Source files containing which content is not retrieved  in this ingest need not be listed or described. SourceInformation A container for capturing information about the source of the ingest. SupportingDataSourceInformation A container for information about upstream sources of data that are used by an ingested source, to derive the knowledge that we ingest. This info is not relevant for typical ingest of an external knowledge source, and applies mainly for describing \"ingest\" of data-derived KPs like ICEES, COHD, various Multiomics KPs, etc. TargetInformation A structure for capturing information about the target dataset / knowledge graph output by the ingest, including what types of edges and nodes were produced, modeling rationale, and what modeling changes might be considered in future iterations.

Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality, such as Atrial septal defect. The HPO is currently being developed using the medical literature, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM. HPO currently contains over 18,000 terms and over 156,000 annotations to hereditary diseases. The HPO project and others have developed software for phenotype-driven differential diagnostics, genomic diagnostics, and translational research. The Human Phenotype Ontology group curates and assembles over 115,000 HPO-related annotations (\"HPOA\") to hereditary diseases using the HPO ontology. Here we create Biolink associations between diseases and phenotypic features, together with their evidence, and age of onset and frequency (if known). Disease annotations here are also cross-referenced to the MONarch Disease Ontology (MONDO) (https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/).
