  description:
    The [Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)](https://hpo.jax.org/) provides a 
    standard vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease.
    Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality, such as Atrial septal defect. 
    The HPO is currently being developed using the medical literature, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM. 
    HPO currently contains over 18,000 terms and over 156,000 annotations to hereditary diseases. 
    The HPO project and others have developed software for phenotype-driven differential diagnostics,
    genomic diagnostics, and translational research.
    
    The Human Phenotype Ontology group curates and assembles over 115,000 HPO-related annotations ("HPOA")
    to hereditary diseases using the HPO ontology. Here we create Biolink associations between diseases
    and phenotypic features, together with their evidence, and age of onset and frequency (if known).
    Disease annotations here are also cross-referenced to the MONarch Disease Ontology (MONDO)
    (https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/).

    There are four HPOA ingests ('disease-to-phenotype' (includes capture of disease modes of inheritance,
    'gene-to-phenotype' and 'gene-to-disease') that parse out records from the 
    HPO Phenotype Annotation File (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp/hpoa/phenotype.hpoa).

  utility:
    The HPO and associated annotations are a flagship product of the Monarch Initiative 
    (https://monarchinitiative.org/), an NIH-supported international consortium dedicated
    to semantic integration of biomedical and model organism data with the ultimate goal
    of improving biomedical research. The human phenotype/disease/gene knowledge integration
    aligns well with the general mission of the Biomedical Data Translator.  As a consequence,
    several members of the Monarch Initiative are direct participants in the Biomedical Data Translator,
    with Monarch data forming one primary knowledge source contributing to Translator knowledge graphs.
  scope:
    Covers curated Disease, Phenotype and Genes relationships annotated with Human Phenotype Ontology terms.

    filtered_records:
      Records where we determine that the reported G-P association was inferred
      over a G-D associated type with the value "POLYGENIC" or "UNKNOWN"
    rationale:
      HPO will infer a Gene-Phenotype association G1-P1 in cases where G1 causes,
      contributes_to, or is associated with D1, and D1 is associated with a Phenotype P1.
      This logic holds for Mendelian disease where a single gene is causal and thus
      responsible for all associated phenotypes. It does not necessarily hold for 
      Polygenic or Unknown diseases where the gene may be one of many contributing factors,
      and thus does not necessarily contribute to or have an association with each phenotype of the disease.
  future_considerations:
  - category: edge_content
    consideration:
      Consider bringing back G-P associations based on inferences over
      Polygenic or Unknown Diseases if we establish a confidence annotation paradigm 
      that lets us indicate these inferences to be weaker than those inferred over
      Mendelian diseases where the Gene is individually causal for the disease and all of its phenotypes.
