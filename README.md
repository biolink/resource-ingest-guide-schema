<details>
To run commands you may use good old make or the command runner [just](https://github.com/casey/just/) which is a better choice on Windows.
Use the `make` command or `duty` commands to generate project artefacts:
* `make help` or `just --list`: list all pre-defined tasks
* `make all` or `just all`: make everything
* `make deploy` or `just deploy`: deploys site
