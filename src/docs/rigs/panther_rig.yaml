  description: >-
    The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System 
    was designed to classify proteins (and their genes) in order to facilitate
    high-throughput analysis. The core of PANTHER is a comprehensive, annotated
    library of gene family phylogenetic trees. All nodes in the tree have persistent
    identifiers that are maintained between versions of PANTHER, providing a
    stable substrate for annotations of protein properties like subfamily and function.

    Homology relationships between human genes and other model research species
    like mouse, rat and many other species can be suggestive of the biological
    function of genes, since gene function can often be partially inferred
    from experimental observations - in the model species - which cannot be
    easily or ethically replicated in human beings.

    rationale: >-
      Panther contains a huge number of records covering orthologs across 144 diverse species
      (as of September 2025), but our core interest in Translator focuses on genes in taxa close
      in evolutionary terms to human, thus having significant genetic, molecular and physiological 
      annotation closer to human biology in character. It is also expected that the genes of these
      evolutionarily close species also already have a significant assignment of functional roles 
      partially inferred from other model organisms (e.g. developmental gene functions mapped 
      from fruit fly or nematode onto mouse genes, but also experimentally tested in mouse).
      The character of genetic and physiological systems are much more similar between humans and 
      mice or rats, in particular, studied responses in pharmacology, metabolism, and the immune system.

      The Monarch Initiative ingest of Panther data (https://github.com/monarch-initiative/pantherdb-orthologs-ingest)
      sometimes attempts to map eccentric identifiers to the NCBI gene identifier space. The initial iteration of 
      the Panther ingest in Translator does not attempt to do this at this time, but rather simply uses the given
      UniProt identifier.
