  description: "SIGNOR 3.0, https://signor.uniroma2.it, is a public repository that captures causal information and represents it according to an 'activity-flow' model. SIGNOR provides freely-accessible static maps of causal interactions that can be tailored, pruned and refined to build dynamic and predictive models. Each signaling relationship is annotated with an effect (up/down-regulation) and with the mechanism (e.g. binding, phosphorylation, transcriptional activation, etc.) causing the regulation of the target entity. Since its latest release, SIGNOR has undergone a significant upgrade including: (i) a new website that offers an improved user experience and novel advanced search and graph tools; (ii) a significant content growth adding up to a total of approx. 33,000 manually-annotated causal relationships between more than 8900 biological entities; (iii) an increase in the number of manually annotated pathways, currently including pathways deregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection or involved in neurodevelopment synaptic transmission and metabolism, among others; (iv) additional features such as new model to represent metabolic reactions and a new confidence score assigned to each interaction."

  utility: "Signor is a rich source of manually curated, well provenanced causal relationships between molecular entities including genes, protein/complexes, and chemicals, which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases - including treatment predictions, gene-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries. It's main focus is causal protein/gene interactions, but it also includes some chemical interactions"
  
# FOR QI - WHY DO YOU MENTION THERAPEUTIC AND MARKER/MECHANISM AND STATISTICAL INFERENCES HERE?  AFAIK SIGNOR DOES NOT INCLUDE THIS TYPE OF INFO.  MAYBE THIS IS A COPY /PASTE ERROR FROM THE CTD RIG?
  scope: "This initial ingest of Signor covers curated Gene to Gene associations that report therapeutic and marker/mechanism relationships, and inferred statistical associations generated by Signor."

    # FOR QI - THE FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS FIELD IN THIS SECTION IS MEANT TO CAPTURE ADDITIONAL CONTENT THAT MAY BE INGESTED IN FUTURE ITERATIONS.  BELOW YOU REPORT A MODELING CONSIDERATION, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR THE FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS FIELD IN THE TARGET_INFO SECTION BELOW.

  # FOR QI: THIS IS MEANT TO CAPTURE THE INFORES ID OF THE PRODUCT OF THE SIGNOR INGEST.  DEFAULT CONVENTION FOR NAMING THESE RIGHT NOW WOULD MAKE THIS "infores:translator-signor"

  # FOR QI - WE SHOULD SIT TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TYPES OF EDGES WE WILL CREATE, AND WHAT QUALIFIERS AND EPC FROM THE SOURCE WE WILL CAPTURE. SIGNOR PROVIDES SOME RICH DATA HERE WE DONT WANT TO LOSE. WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER THE MOST CONCISE WAY TO ENCODE THESE EDGE TYPES, GIVEN THE CROSS-PRODUCT OF DIFFERENT 'ENTITY TYPES' THAT ARE IN THE DATA, AND THE PREDICATES THEY USE. THE EDGE TYEPS BELOW SEEM TO DESCRIBE AN ARBITRARY AND INCOMPLETE SET OF POSSIBLE PAIRS IN THE SOURCE DATA. I STARTED AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE MIGHT INCLUDE, AND HOW WE MIGHT MODEL IT, IN THE SPREADSHEETS HERE: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tqimhXxpWzQdfNxanpW-rAaLnmsP80YZUthY5O4mEc8/edit?gid=757331128#gid=757331128

      # FOR QI / ALL - IDS FOR PROTEINS IN THE DATA ARE FROM UNIPROT, BUT ABOVE YOU SAY THAT THE SUBJECT AND OBJECT CATEGORIES ARE GENES.  WE SHOULD NOTE THIS IN AN ADDITIONAL_NOTES FIELD, AND EXPLAIN WHY/HOW/WHEN THE MAPPING TO GENE IDS AND A GENE CATEGORY HAPPENS (NOT SURE IF THIS HAPPENS DURING NODE NORM? OR A SEPARATE CONFLATION STEP?
