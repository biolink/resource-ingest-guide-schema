    infores_id:  infores:ctd
    description: >-
      CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding
      about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides knowledge,
      manually curated from the literature, about chemicals and their relationship to
      other biological entities: chemical to gene/protein interactions plus chemical to
      disease and gene to disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional
      and pathway data to aid in the development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying
      environmentally influenced diseases. It also generates novel inferences by further
      analyzing the knowledge they curate/create - based on statistically significant connections
      with intermediate concept (e.g. Chemical X associated with Disease Y based on shared associations
      with a common set of genes).

# Information about Ingested Content (the scope, content, and rationale for what is included and excluded in this ingest)

    utility: >-
      CTD is a rich source of manually curated chemical associations to other biological entities
      which are an important type of edge for Translator query and reasoning use cases, including
      treatment predictions, chemical-gene regulation predictions, and pathfinder queries. It is
      one of the few sources that focus on non-drug chemicals, e.g. environmental stressors, and
      how these are related to diseases, biological processes, and genes.
    scope: >-
      This initial ingest of CTD covers curated Chemical to Disease associations that report therapeutic
      and marker/mechanism relationships, and inferred statistical associations generated by CTD.
      Additional types of Chemical associations will be added in future updates to the ingest.

    included_content:  
      - file_name:  CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
        included_records:  Curated therapeutic and marker/mechanism associations (records where a "DirectEvidence" value is populated with type "T" or "M"), as well as inferred associtionas (records lacking a value in the DirectEvidence column)
        fields_used:  ChemicalName, ChemicalID, CasRN, DiseaseName, DiseaseID, DirectEvidence, InferenceGeneSymbol, InferenceScore, OmimIDs, PubMedIDs

    filtered_content: 
      - file_name:  CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
        filtered_records: None
        rationale: Currently taking all records with no publication count or inference score cutoffs - but these may be added in future iterations

    future_considerations:  
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: Consider adding some threshold / cutoff to remove lower quality/confidence inferences (e.g. based on shared gene count, publication count, or inference score. At present we include even inferences based on a single shared gene/pub - which is not really meaningful.
        relevant_files: CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv.gz
      - category:  edge_content
        consideration: Consider ingesting additional chemical-disease edges reporting statistical correlations from environmental exposure studies from CTD_exposure_events.tsv.gz. This is a unique/novel source for this kind of knowledge, but there is not a lot of data here, and utility is not yet clear.
        relevant_files: CTD_exposure_events.tsv.gz
      - category: edge_content
        consideration: While the current ingest includes only Chemical-Disease Associations, future iterations will include additional types of associations between Chemicals and GO Terms, Molecular Phenotypes, Genes, etc. See the Ingest Survey table linked below for more details.
      - category: node_property_content
        consideration: Molepro ingested chemical properties in its previous ingests - which we will likely bring in at some point.
      - category:  edge_property_content
        consideration: Consider an edge property that reports the list of shared genes supporting C-D inferred associations.

# Information about the Graph Output by the ingest 
  target_info:
    infores_id:  infores:translator-ctd-kgx
    edge_type_info:
      - subject_categories:
          - biolink:ChemicalEntity
        predicates:  
          - biolink:treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat
        object_categories:
          - biolink:DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature
        knowledge_level:
          - knowledge_assertion
        agent_type:
          - manual_agent
        edge_properties:
          - publications
        ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with a "T" (therapeutic) DirectEvidence code indicate the chemical to be a "potential" treatment in virtue of its clinical use or study - which maps best to the Biolink predicate 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat'.
        additional_notes: The 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat' predicate is used to avoid making too strong a claim, as CTDs definition of its "T" flag is broad ("a chemical that has a known or potential therapeutic role in a disease"), which covered cases where a chemical may formally treat a disease or only have been studied or applied to treat a disease. All edges are manual agent knowledge assertions, as the ingested data is based on manual literature curation.
      - subject_categories:
          - biolink:ChemicalEntity
        predicates: 
          - biolink:correlated_with
        object_categories:
          - biolink:DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature
        knowledge_level:
          - knowledge_assertion
        agent_type:
          - manual_agent
        edge_properties:
          - publications
        ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with a DirectEvidence code of "M" (marker/mechanism) indicate that the chemical is manually flagged as a marker or contributing factor for a condition. This implies that at minimum there is correlation between the presence of the chemical and condition, for which we use the Biolink 'correlated_with' predicate.
      - subject_categories:
          - biolink:ChemicalEntity
        predicates: 
          - biolink:associated_with
        object_categories:

          - data_analysis_pipeline
        edge_properties:
          - publications
          - has_confidence_score
        ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with an inference score have a statistically significant number of shared gene associations that suggest a biological relationship may exist. The statistical basis of this general inferred relationship is best reported using the Biolink 'assocaited_with' predicate.

    node_type_info:  
      - node_category: biolink:ChemicalEntity
        source_identifier_types:
          - "MeSH"
        additional_notes: Majority are Biolink SmallMolecules
      - node_category: biolink:DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature
        source_identifier_types:
          - "MeSH"

    future_considerations:  
      - category: edge_properties 
        consideration: Revisit use of 'has_confidence_score' edge property if/when we refactor this part of the Biolink Model.
      - category: predicates
        consideration: Revisit 'correlated_with' and 'treats_or_studied_or_applied_to_treat' predicates if/when we refactor modeling or conventions here.

    additional_notes: >-
      CTD_chemicals_diseases.tsv. data includes one row per curated 'T', or 'M' association with pub reference(s), plus one row per shared gene association with pub reference(s), and inference scores.
      Separate edges will be created for each type of association reported between a chemical and a given disease, according to the mappings described above.
      All "shared gene" rows in the source data file for a given C-D pair will be aggregated into a single 'associated_with' edge that reports an associated_with relationship with the inference score as an edge property (and possibly the list of shared genes).
      This means that for a given C-D pair in the CTD file, there may be 1, 2, or 3 separate edges created in the Translator graph.
