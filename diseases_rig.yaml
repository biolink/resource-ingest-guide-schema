source_info:
  infores_id: "infores:diseases"
  description: "The DISEASES database is a web resource that integrates knowledge on gene-disease associations. It generates de novo associations through automated text mining, and aggregates associations from external sources of manually curated knowledge and GWAS-based study results. The associations are assigned a confidence score to facilitate comparisons across data types and sources."

  ingest_categories:
    - primary_knowledge_provider
    - aggregation_provider
  utility: "DISEASES contains gene-disease associations from unique sources, including their own text-mining pipeline and external human-curated resources that are hard to access or parse (MedlinePlus, AmyCo). These associations could be used in MVP1 (may treat disease X) or Pathfinder queries."
  scope: "This ingest covers text-mined co-occurrence associations, and manually curated associations from MedlinePlus and AmyCo. Content aggregated from UniProt is not ingested. Experiment-based associations from TIGA data are not ingested (we will find a direct source of GWAS-based associations - TIGA and / or something else)."
